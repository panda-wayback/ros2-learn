# Package Documentation

Currently, documentation is a bit all over the place. This list is certainly
not extensive, but I find it helpful to have quick links to the frequently
used packages.

## Core Documentation

 * [ROS 2 Overview](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/)
 * [Ament CMake](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Ament-CMake-Documentation/)
 * [ROS2 Launch](https://github.com/ros2/launch/blob/master/launch/doc/source/architecture.rst)

## Higher Level Packages

 * [Navigation2](https://navigation.ros.org/)
